Trying to learn something new

I'm actually trying GitHub because my brother introduce me it. Now he's teaching me how a real developer work.
Right now I have 19 years old and I'm studying Telecommunication engineering. But till the day, I've been 
doing all things in the wrong way.
So... I'm here to TRY!


This is getting exiting. I hope I use it someday when I have found a job.
